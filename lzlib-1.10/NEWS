Changes in version 1.10:

The function 'LZ_compress_finish' now adjusts the dictionary size for
each member.

The option '--loose-trailing', has been added to minilzip.

The test used by lzlib to discriminate trailing data from a corrupt
header in multimember or concatenated files has been improved to a
Hamming distance (HD) of 3, and the 3 bit flips must happen in different
magic bytes for the test to fail. As a consequence, lzlib now returns a
data error when some kinds of files are appended to a lzip file as
trailing data.
The '--loose-trailing' option of minilzip can be used to ignore such
trailing data when decompressing.
Lziprecover can be used to remove conflicting trailing data from a file.

Option '-S, --volume-size' of minilzip now keeps input files unchanged.

The 'bits/byte' ratio has been replaced with the inverse compression
ratio in the output of minilzip.

minilzip now shows a final diagnostic at verbosity level 1 (-v) or
higher if any file fails the test when testing multiple files.

minilzip no longer adds a second '.lz' extension to the argument of '-o'
if it already ends in '.lz' or '.tlz'.

minilzip now shows the dictionary size at verbosity level 4 (-vvvv) when
decompressing or testing.

The new chapter 'Invoking minilzip' has been added to the manual.
