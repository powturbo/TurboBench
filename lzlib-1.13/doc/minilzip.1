.TH MINILZIP "1" "January 2022" "minilzip 1.13" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
minilzip \- reduces the size of files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minilzip
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Minilzip is a test program for the compression library lzlib, fully
compatible with lzip 1.4 or newer.
.PP
Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one
of gzip or bzip2. Lzip uses a simplified form of the 'Lempel\-Ziv\-Markov
chain\-Algorithm' (LZMA) stream format and provides a 3 factor integrity
checking to maximize interoperability and optimize safety. Lzip can compress
about as fast as gzip (lzip \fB\-0\fR) or compress most files more than bzip2
(lzip \fB\-9\fR). Decompression speed is intermediate between gzip and bzip2.
Lzip is better than gzip and bzip2 from a data recovery perspective. Lzip
has been designed, written, and tested with great care to replace gzip and
bzip2 as the standard general\-purpose compressed format for unix\-like
systems.

.PP
If no file names are given, or if a file is '\-', minilzip compresses or
decompresses from standard input to standard output.
Numbers may be followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000,
Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024, M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...
Dictionary sizes 12 to 29 are interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12
to 2^29 bytes.
.PP
The bidimensional parameter space of LZMA can't be mapped to a linear
scale optimal for all files. If your files are large, very repetitive,
etc, you may need to use the options \fB\-\-dictionary\-size\fR and \fB\-\-match\-length\fR
directly to achieve optimal performance.
.PP
To extract all the files from archive 'foo.tar.lz', use the commands
\&'tar \fB\-xf\fR foo.tar.lz' or 'minilzip \fB\-cd\fR foo.tar.lz | tar \fB\-xf\fR \-'.
.PP
Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or
invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (e.g., bug) which
caused minilzip to panic.
.PP
The ideas embodied in lzlib are due to (at least) the following people:
Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv (for the LZ algorithm), Andrey Markov (for the
definition of Markov chains), G.N.N. Martin (for the definition of range
encoding), Igor Pavlov (for putting all the above together in LZMA), and
Julian Seward (for bzip2's CLI).
